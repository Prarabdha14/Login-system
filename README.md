Login System using Node.js, Express & MongoDB
This project is a basic user authentication system built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB (via Mongoose), and Handlebars (HBS) for templating. It allows users to log in using a secure username and password system, with passwords hashed using bcrypt for added security.

The system connects to MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-hosted MongoDB service, and includes a route to create a default user (admin / admin123) for quick testing. Error messages and feedback are displayed through dynamically rendered views.

Ideal for learning backend user authentication, MongoDB integration, and server-side rendering with Express and Handlebars.
